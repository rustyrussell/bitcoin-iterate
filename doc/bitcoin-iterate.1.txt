BITCOIN-ITERATE(1)
==================
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
bitcoin-iterate - Iterate over bitcoind's block files.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*bitcoin-iterate* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*bitcoin-iterate* creates a text dump of the blockchain contents, by
directly reading *bitcoind*'s block files.  This is much faster than
using *bitcoin-cli* to query bitcoind directly, though *bitcoind* can
provide more contextual metadata.

It iterates each block (from genesis to longest tip), and within that
block iterates each transaction (from coinbase onwards in block
order), and within that transaction iterates each input (in order),
and then each output (in order).

OPTIONS
-------
*--block*='FORMAT'::
  Print out the format string for each block.  Escape codes are prefixed
  with '%':

  %bl: block length
  %bv: block version
  %bp: block prev hash as a 64-character little-endian hex string
  %bm: block merkle hash as a 64-character little-endian hex string
  %bs: block timestamp
  %bt: block target
  %bn: block nonce
  %bc: block transaction count
  %bh: block hash as a 64-character little-endian hex string
  %bN: block height (0 == genesis)
  %bH: block header as a hex string

*--tx,--transaction*='FORMAT'::
  Print out the format string for each transaction (in the order they
  are in the block).  All the block escape codes are valid, and the
  following additional ones:

  %th: transaction hash as a 64-character little-endian hex string
  %tv: transaction version
  %ti: transaction input count
  %to: transaction output count
  %tt: transaction locktime
  %tl: transaction length
  %tF: transaction fee paid by block (negative for coinbase reward)
  %tN: transaction number within block
  %tD: transaction bitcoin days destroyed (by block times)
  %tX: transaction as a hex string (including inputs and outputs)

*--input*='FORMAT'::
  Print out the format string for each transaction input (in the order
  they are in the transaction).  All the block and transaction escape
  codes are valid, and the following additional ones:

  %ih: input hash as a 64-character-little-endian hex string
  %ii: input index
  %il: input script length
  %is: input script as a hex string
  %iN: input number within transaction
  %iB: input UTXO block number (0 for coinbase)
  %iX: input as a hex string

*--output*='FORMAT'::
  Print out the format string for each transaction output (in the order
  they are in the transaction).  All the block and transaction escape
  codes are valid, and the following additional ones:

  %oa: output amount
  %ol: output script length
  %os: output script as a hex string.
  %oN: output number within transaction
  %oU: output is unspendable (0==spendable)
  %oX: output as a hex string

*--end-hash*::
  Stop iteration at this block hash.

*--start-hash*::
  Start iteration at this block hash.

*--end*::
  Stop iteration at this block number (on longest chain).

*--start*::
  Start iteration at this block number (on longest chain).

*-q, --quiet*::
  Don't print progress messages, just print the output.  All progress
  messages are printed to standard output prefixed with
  "bitcoin-iterate:" for easy filtering anyway.

*-t, --testnet*::
  Expect blocks from testnet3 rather than the main bitcoin chain (and
  change default blockdir to be ~/.bitcoin/testnet3/blocks).

*--progress*='NUM-CHARS'::
  Print '.' to standard error such that at there will be this many drawn
  at completion.

*--blockdir*='DIRECTORY'::
  Use this directory to find block files rather than ~/.bitcoin/blocks.

*--cache*='DIRECTORY'::
  Cache results in this directory; particularly useful
  for repeated UTXO runs with same '--start'.

*--no-mmap*::
  Use read, not mmap, on the block files.  This may be slower.

*-h, --help*::
  Print a brief help message, which is less useful than this manpage.

EXAMPLES
--------
.Simple sanity check: read blocks and do nothing
===================================================================
bitcoin-iterate
===================================================================

.Print out the height and length of every block, separated by a space
===================================================================
bitcoin-iterate --block='%bh %bl'
===================================================================

.Print out the block height and length of every transaction
===================================================================
bitcoin-iterate --tx='height=%bh length=%tl'
===================================================================

.Print out the length of every scriptSig (input script)
===================================================================
bitcoin-iterate --input=%il
===================================================================

.Print out the length of every scriptPubKey (output script).
===================================================================
bitcoin-iterate --output=%ol
===================================================================

.Print out <block number>,<transaction hash>,<script> for each output
===================================================================
bitcoin-iterate --output=%bn,%th,%os
===================================================================

NOTES
-----
Use of *%tF*, *%iB*, *%ia* or *%ip* significantly slows iteration, as
this requires *bitcoin-iterate* to track unspent outputs.

BUGS
----
This manpage documents how it should work, not how it does work.

The chain of blocks to follow is determined solely by block height,
which may not be the same as strongest chain in theoretical cases.
